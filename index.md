Omnipay is a payment processing library for PHP. It has been designed based on
ideas from [Active Merchant](//activemerchant.org/), plus experience implementing
dozens of gateways for [CI Merchant](https://github.com/expressodev/ci-merchant). It has a clear and consistent API,
is fully unit tested, and even comes with an example application to get you started.

## Why use Omnipay?

So, why use Omnipay instead of a gateway's official PHP package/example code?

- Because you can learn one API and use it in multiple projects using different payment gateways
- Because if you need to change payment gateways you won't need to rewrite your code
- Because most official PHP payment gateway libraries are a mess
- Because most payment gateways have exceptionally poor documentation
- Because you are writing a shopping cart and need to support multiple gateways

## Upgrading to 3.0

If you are upgrading from a pre-3.0 version of Omnipay, please note that there are some changes regarding the HTTP Client.
There have also been some changes to how gateway instances are created. See the [full release notes](/changelog/) for more details.
